# Sumobots
This repository has all of the code for the Inspire Robotics Sumobots competition. 
This repo contains the (in progress) rewrite of the original version. 

## What is Sumobots?
Sumobots is a project started by FRC team 4283, INSPIRE Robotics, and FTC team 10489 Missing Parts. 
The goal of the project is to expand the FRC and FTC seasons and promote STEM in central Ohio. 

This repository contains the code for the Driverstation, Robot API, and FMS. 
The Sumobots code is a completely independent control system intended for Raspberry Pis.

## Documentation
Currently, due to the rewrite, there is little documentation. Eventually, a docs folder will be added with some
 documentation such as javadocs for Robot API and tutorials for how to use the FMS and driverstation. 
 
## Planned Features
There are currently many planned features. Below is a somewhat complete list of the current goals:

- Remote code deployment
- API for interacting with Raspberry Pi hardware (Pi4j)
- Support for motor controllers, sensors, and other PWM devices
- Driverstation with custom dashboard
